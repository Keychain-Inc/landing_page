            <h2>Wallets</h2>
            <p>A cryptocurrency wallet is a tool for interacting with a blockchain network. It stores public and
                private keys, enabling transactions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Key (Address):</strong> The address for receiving transactions, shareable with
                    others. It can be shared publicly to receive funds.</li>
                <li><strong>Private Key:</strong> A confidential key for accessing and managing funds. It must be
                    kept secure and never shared.</li>
                <li><strong>Wallet Types:</strong> Wallets can be software-based (desktop, mobile, web), hardware
                    devices, or paper-based for enhanced security.</li>
                <li><strong>Backup and Recovery:</strong> It's crucial to backup wallet private keys or seed
                    phrases, which are used to recover access to funds in case of device loss or failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Address Formats:</strong> Addresses can have different formats depending on the
                    blockchain, such as Legacy, SegWit, and Bech32 for Bitcoin.</li>
                <li><strong>Cold Storage / Wallet:</strong> Storing cryptocurrency offline, typically on a hardware
                    wallet or paper wallet, to minimize the risk of hacking or theft.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Blockchain</h2>
            <p>Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across many computers, ensuring security
                and integrity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blocks:</strong> Records are grouped in blocks, linked together in an immutable chain.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Managed by a network of nodes, not a central authority.</li>
                <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once recorded, data in blocks cannot be altered retroactively.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Consensus Mechanisms:</strong> Different consensus algorithms are used to validate
                    transactions and add new blocks, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All transactions on a public blockchain are visible to all
                    participants, providing transparency and auditability.</li>
                <li><strong>Nodes:</strong> Independent clients that verify every block and transaction on the
                    network. Full nodes keep the full state and have verified every transaction that has happened on
                    the chain to verify validity.
                <li><strong>Fork:</strong> A divergence in the blockchain. Forks can be non-backwards compatible (hard
                    forks) or backwards compatible (soft forks) due to
                    disagreements or upgrades in the network protocol.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Cryptocurrency</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates
                independently of central banks. It enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> Not controlled by governments or financial institutions, but by
                    a distributed network of users.</li>
                <li><strong>Pseudonymous:</strong> Transactions are transparent but identities are represented by
                    pseudonyms, providing privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Volatile:</strong> Prices can experience significant fluctuations due to market
                    sentiment, adoption, and regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Fungibility:</strong> Most cryptocurrencies are fungible, meaning each unit is
                    interchangeable and indistinguishable from another.</li>
                <li><strong>Borderless:</strong> Cryptocurrencies can be transferred across borders without the need
                    for intermediaries or currency exchange.</li>
                <li><strong>Altcoin:</strong> Any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Altcoins often aim to improve
                    upon Bitcoin's limitations or offer additional features and use cases.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Exchanges</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Centralized Exchanges (CEX):</strong> Traditional exchanges that act as intermediaries,
                    facilitating trades between users. Examples include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken.</li>
                <li><strong>Decentralized Exchanges (DEX):</strong> Peer-to-peer trading platforms that operate
                    without a central authority, using smart contracts to facilitate trades. Examples include
                    Uniswap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap.</li>
                <li><strong>Order Types:</strong> Exchanges offer various order types, such as market orders
                    (instant execution at current market price) and limit orders (execution at a specified price or
                    better).</li>
                <li><strong>Trading Pairs:</strong> Cryptocurrencies are traded in pairs, such as BTC/USD (Bitcoin
                    against US dollar) or ETH/BTC (Ethereum against Bitcoin).</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> The ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without affecting
                    its price. Higher liquidity allows for larger trades with minimal price impact.</li>
            </ul>

    </div>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, launched in 2009. It introduced
                decentralized digital currency and operates on a distributed network, with no single authority
                controlling it. Transactions are validated by network nodes, ensuring integrity and security.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limited Supply:</strong> Fixed supply of 21 million coins, gradually released through
                    mining.</li>
                <li><strong>Pseudonymous:</strong> Transactions are transparent but identities are represented by
                    pseudonymous addresses.</li>
                <li><strong>Divisibility:</strong> One bitcoin can be divided into smaller units (satoshis) for
                    micropayments and efficient transactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Satoshi:</strong> The founder(s?) behind Bitcoin. The identity remains unknown.</li>
                <li><strong>Satoshis (Sats):</strong> The smallest unit that can be transferred on the Bitcoin
                    network. Worth 0.00000001 BTC.</li>
                <li><strong>Whitepaper:</strong> The original document published by Satoshi Nakamoto outlining the
                    concept and technical details of Bitcoin.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Mining</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin mining creates new bitcoins and validates transactions by solving complex mathematical
                problems. Miners are rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW):</strong> Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles and add
                    blocks of transactions to the blockchain.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty Adjustment:</strong> Mining difficulty adjusts automatically to maintain a
                    stable supply of new bitcoins.</li>
                <li><strong>Halving:</strong> The mining reward is halved every 210,000 blocks, gradually reducing
                    the rate of new bitcoin creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> Bitcoin mining requires significant computational power and
                    energy, raising concerns about its environmental impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Confirmations:</strong> The number of blocks added to the blockchain after a
                    transaction. The more confirmations, the more secure and irreversible the transaction becomes.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>

                automatically enforce the rules and penalties defined within them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solidity:</strong> Programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum
                    blockchain.</li>
                <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once deployed, smart contract code cannot be modified, ensuring
                    transparency and trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Financial agreements, supply chain management, voting systems,
                    insurance, and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):</strong> Organizations governed by smart
                    contracts, enabling decentralized decision-making and management.</li>
                <li><strong>Gas:</strong> The fuel for the Ethereum network. Paid for in ETH, every operation for a
                    transaction has a small fee, with the gas price being the amount you're willing to spend per 1
                    gas consumed.</li>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Alright now that you know roughly what's what let's go through how Cryptos generally operate at a high
            level
            and walk you through your first transaction.</p>
        <p>To get started you'll need to sign up to an exchange such as coinbase.com or binance.com and purchase
            some
            cryptocurrency or find someone to send you some. Once you have some ready to be sent to your own wallet
            we
            can move to the first step.</p>

    </div>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Setting Up Your Wallet</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Download and setup your wallet:</strong> We recommend that the wallet you use be a reputable
                    one
                    as any wallet that controls your keys controls your funds. Once you download a wallet you'll see
                    that it
                    asks you to save your private key or seed. Make sure to keep this somewhere safe and preferably
                    stored
                    not anywhere that has an internet connection. If this gets lost or stolen there's no way to recover
                    your
                    funds.</li>
                <li><strong>Receiving crypto:</strong> Now that your wallet is ready to go you should see a button to
                    receive. Press this and you'll be shown your unique address belonging to your private key. Use this
                    as
                    the recipient for your cryptocurrency, make sure to use the correct address for the correct
                    cryptocurrency as each crypto has its own address for your key.</li>
                <li><strong>Sending crypto:</strong> Now that you have some find someone to send some crypto to. Walk
                    them
                    through if needed and then get your wallet out.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Go to the send option and put in their address and the amount you want to send. You'll then see a
                suggested
                fee for the transaction. This fee will be used by miners or stakers to decide which transactions get in
                first. The higher the fee the faster it'll be included in a block. The suggested fee should be fine.</p>
            <p>Confirm the transaction and wait for your transaction to be confirmed. And you're done.</p>
            <p>Congrats you just sent someone money with no intermediary, anywhere in the world and in 10m or less.</p>

            <h2>Using DAPPS</h2>
            <p>Now that you have the basics covered lets buy some crypto using a decentralized exchange. For this you
                will
                need metamask (metamask.io) and some Ether (the currency for the Ethereum network).</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to app.uniswap.com and authorize the site to connect to metamask</li>
                <li>On the bottom box select a token. You can also put a smart contract address for a non listed token
                    to be
                    able to trade it (try 0xfa6de2697D59E88Ed7Fc4dFE5A33daC43565ea41 for a token that acts as an index
                    for
                    DEFI)</li>
                <li>Choose how much you want to spend or receive</li>
                <li>Choose your gas fee (note the difference between gas price being how much you pay per 1 gas and gas
                    limit being the max gas you're willing to pay for)</li>
                <li>Confirm the transaction</li>
                <li>You're done. You just traded on a completely autonomous exchange thats controlled by no humans and
                    is
                    just code</li>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Crypto?</h2>
            <p>CryptoCurrency allows you to, for the first time, be in complete control for your money online. No one
                has
                access to your money, no one can freeze your accounts, take fees, lose your money, you and only you are
                responsible. Crypto allows you full control and makes cross border or even national payments easy and
                faster
                than traditional rails. You can send money from the US, to South Africa to China, back to the US in
                under
                60s and pay fees usually under 1 USD for any amount.</p>
            <p>Crypto can also act as a hedge against inflation and monetary policy where banks simply print more money,
                making the value for your savings go down slowly without you knowing. Assets such as Bitcoin and
                Ethereum
                are deflationary, holding value against inflationary currencies.</p>
            <p>Crypto allows you to own your money and control how you spend it.</p>
